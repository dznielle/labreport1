I got this output because `cd` with no argument results in being taken to the home directory.
 
This is not an error.

I got this output because you cannot `cd` into a file. A file is not a directory, so you cannot use `cd` on it.

The output is an error because you cannot change directories into a file. hello.txt is not a directory, so the input resulted in an error.
